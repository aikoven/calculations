Add support to locate labels inside vertex circles.
Add saving graph to image.
Add vertex equivalence.
Add cocliques.
Add layout calibrating window.
Add missing exceptional groups.
Fix window sizing.
Add latex representations.
Add integer cache.

Test performance of group and integer caching:
    Create list of different parameters with some constraints.
    Create list of permutations of that list.
    Create groups for each parameters in each permutation.
    Try for different constraints.

    Or:
    Create huge dict of fake parameters;
    Place real parameters in it;
    Compare performance of creation of groups with searching the dict.
    Try for different real parameters.
